i made a custom agent website_dev. i need to modify the agent's configuration. how do i do that
/agent edit website_dev
I tried the command `/agent edit website_dev`, this resulted in an error saying I cannot edit built-in agent 'website_dev'
I want to add resources
I want to add "file:~/dev/website"
now also add "file:~/devlog/gameboy-blog"
i have a question, why is the .kiro directory this agent is in inside of ~/dev/website? all the other ones are in ~/.kiro
okay so lets make some changes here then. I have a blog stored in ~/devlog/gameboy-blog and a website in ~/dev/website. please modify so that these are both stored in ~/dev/website, and the old ~/dev/website gets moved to ~/dev/website/site, and the blog is stored in ~/dev/website/blog/gameboy-blog.
okay, i did it. now please modify website_dev so that the resources array has the correct file paths
actually, change the blog/gameboy-blog to just blog

in my gameboy-blog, we added a welcome post. Please modify the list at the end of the blog to be indented and have some space between p and the list
that did not fix the issue, can you add soem styling that makes ul elements have a bit of space
great, now do the same for headings to also have a tiny bit of space
actually you can undo that change
/editor
I want you to change the styling for some things.\n\n- The background should be #21252C\n- All text should be #A6B0BA\n- All h1 elements should be #79CDE5 while all other headings must be #E2BF75\n- All hyperlinks must be #E57BEA
modify the date  in the blog to be #F98553
now, i've put a new font called fira code in the blog's assets folder. you can move/restructure things to be of a better structure if that is best. change all text to fira code font
Make all heading text less bold
now it's too light, a bit more bold please
now, add some space on the top of each header
now, in the blog's home page, change the title to gameboy color emulator blog
great, now make the date be side by side with the link to the posts. add a character of your choosing to separate them
please don't use a bullet, maybe an em dash, |, or something else
on the home page, make the date text size equal to the post link
please do not make this impact the blog post date
please chnge  the recent posts header to just Posts
i accidentally lost everything. can you bring it back
everything was deleted, including that directory, i readded it
please change the url of the site to husaamkhan.com/gameboy-blog
after making this change i get an error saying '/' not found.
okay undo that change
nevermind actually keep it. i need you to explain something to me
i have a personal website that i created in webstudio, which you can find in the site directory. this site is hosted on github pages as husaamkhan.com. i want it so that when the user goes to husaamkhan.com/gameboy-blog, they open the blog
